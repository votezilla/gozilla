JUST FIXED:

A 8 - Add activity tab (like FB notifications, but list all ppl) - 1st pass done


WORKING ON:

A+ - 13 - 1st impression = what is this?  (Need splashscreen(s) / tutorial(s) / about page) (TOM)

A - 8 - Add num notifications javascript on 1 minute timer that asks how many notifications the person should have

POLLS:

Importance
v
  Difficulty
  v
  
A - 8 - cats need to be more obvious that they are clickable, maybe thick underline / link icon / spell it out (i.e. MORE NEWS...) (TOM)
         ^^ + vv
  - provide better underlining for /news articles, Also hover of articles, poss make them blue too.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13840403/edit-line-thickness-of-css-underline-attribute?rq=1#:~:text=You%20can%20adjust%20underline%20position,want%20to%20underline%20an%20href.

      Make article links more obvious.  Do what Yahoo news does on hover - text blue, underline, (bonus for overlay div for brightening).

A 8 - seeing mostly liberal news sources (I need to add Fox News) (TOM)

A 8 - upgrade DigitalOcean instance $5 -> $10

A 8 - Add history for other ppl (also listing of ppl)

A 13 - implement really simple blogging

A - Continue getting feedback from close peeps!!  (Start with Susan, Steve D., Jeff, Tom, Dad, )

B 2 - Poll options need a "Poll options:" label for the group, possibly the character o or [] in front.

B 2 - history - add header or splashscreen explaing what it is (TOM)

B 2 - on sidebar, more ____ (i.e. polls) should be clickable (TOM)
 
B 3 - history needs polls section

B 2 - sidebar h buttons and comment buttons are all small, esp. on mobile, also the '...' should be hidden for now.

B 3 - comments reply - textarea s b cr.d below Reply button w Reply ch.d to X (instead of b4)

B 3 - Ryan's poll with the weird characters... if I vote for the 2nd option as "2 1" with ranked choices, it tells me below that I voted for the wrong one.  
  
B 5 - click on news source / user icon to see their news articles / posts

B 5 - deduce title for link sharing (via button)

FEEDBACK:
C - discussion on what to do when there are too many poll items: http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults2/?postId=95391#comment_71 (may need to change url to viewPollResults w/o 2
  ^ Ryan H: Only listing the first three options in the summary is going to influence votes. Try not including the poll choices in the summary at all? or at least not be able to vote from the summary? Should polls have descriptions? (yes).


TOM FEEDBACK:
D - TOM: Add Votezilla to search engines.  (He tried to search for votezilla.io on the search engine!) (Need to optimize and improve SEO first!) (TOM)
 
~ - no login problems - it was easy! (TOM)

~ - "I don't like questions that require an expert answer." (about quantum physics, self-driving polls) (TOM)
 
~ - on poll, wondered if he could press ENTER instead of clicking on the Vote button.   (TOM)

~ - too many tabs open
 
 
MED-HIGH PRIORITY (for test w/ 10 friends):
	-- DEPLOY May 8, LAUNCH May 11 --
	
= C 2 - add Create your own poll or news post on the left bottom of each news cat (PART I complete - the link.  TODO: feed category from url to default value.)	

C 2 - Break word by width=50% if any option len > 20	

C 3 - max username length is 345 - this is too long!

C 3 - voting from history doesn't work when there are duplicates.  Could just manually remove duplicates in Go after the query.

C 5 - prompt to log in makes you forget your place.  It should open in new window / close window, or remember from location and restore it later.

C 5 - why you voted comment

C 8 - Need to scan page for og:image and use that as a backup.

C 8 - Change between alias and real name depending on a post's (or comment's) privacy settings.

C 8 + ability to message other users or write on a news source' wall

C 8 - organize cat posts in columns to save vertical space, on desktop... oh yeah, there's a reason I didn't do that, it's because of sorting order desktop vs mobile... hmmm.  Send both versions with a media query to decide which to show?  looking up poll option would have to search both of them?  Or just serve the column version, but put high-priority articles in left, low-priority on the right?

C 13 - notifications

  - Enable DDOS prevention somehow
  
  - Allow user to create simple, plaintext Blog (with image insertion for body or just thumbnail).

  -   Alert-for-needing-to-log-in pages should use the modal windows, like viewVoteResults does.  Can prompt for logging in as well.

  - Email system.  Needs to:
  
B 5  =   Fix email - Emailed DO tech support.

  -   Implement Email verification.

  -   Implement Forgot password.
  
  -   Remember previous page or close form upon success, and/or back tri buttons.
 
  -   Send verification email... user doesn't get created until email gets verified.
      Verify email and set emailVerified=True when email is verified

C   - c Univ' - prog intern' + phys' prof'

C 3 - newly-created posts for 'NEWS' show up under 'WORLD NEWS' - country should be set based on whether user is in the US?

C 8 - collapse in columnwise the articles, when viewing a single category or polls.

C 8 - thumbnail appears to be clipped on the left, on mobile - it appears smart crop doesn't always do what I want.  Experiment with manually centering the image, compare results, go with the better option and don't look back.

C 8 - make large_thumbnails (otherwise, a cat takes too long to load... or reduce kMaxArticles to 100?) - but could this get costly?

  - add ability to view news source feed 
  
  - add ability to view user feed

  - ++ created polls to history
  
C 2 - Ryan: "The ellipsis for long comments should be more obvious >> blue and test like show more and an arrow -> or something like that"  

C 2 - history tab should be hidden when user is not logged in

D 2 - ranked vote checkbox should list the rank.

D 3 - sort history just by time posted desc
