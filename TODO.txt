SERVER_PUSH_TODO: 
convert mozilla thumbnail posts to '' on all posts


JUST FIXED:


WORKING ON:

A 13 - Want to view poll results on /news & /article once you've voted on it

A - Start getting feedback from close peeps!!  (Start with Tom, Dad, Jeff, Steve D.)


HIGH PRIORITY (for test w/ Ryan, Tom, Tyler, Mike Munk, Dad): 

POLLS:

Importance
v
  Difficulty
  v

A 13 - Need ability to add new option when voting

A 5 - Make article links more obvious.  Do what Yahoo news does on hover - text blue, underline, (bonus for overlay div for brightening).

A 5 - equalize /news article order a little / prioritize page rank multiplied by less.

A 2 - links & blogs should not be able to be shared to the category 'polls'

A 13 - implement really simple blogging

B 2 - sidebar up/down buttons and comment buttons are all small, esp. on mobile, also the '...' should be hidden for now.

B 3 - comments reply - textarea s b cr.d below Reply button w Reply ch.d to X (instead of b4)

B 3 - Ryan's poll with the weird characters... if I vote for the 2nd option as "2 1" with ranked choices, it tells me below that I voted for the wrong one.  Maybe it's listing a dictionary?
  
B 5 - click on news source / user icon to see their news articles / posts

B 5 - deduce title for link sharing (via button)

B 5 - leave comment prompt after viewing article

B 5 - Add more news API's

B 5 - privacy alias'
              
B 5 - ability to delete posts, comments

B 8 - ability to update posts, comments

B 8 - Allow user to specify new category when creating poll or post, then group all unmatched under Other category.
  
B 13 - https: https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/Jl3G/https-for-free-in-go-with-little-help-of-lets-encrypt.html

B 8 - Add "About" section - or implememnt simple blog first?

B 13 - display the results of polls you've voted on, on /news.  May require a pollTallyService to count results ahead of time and store them in a json column in the poll.

MED-HIGH PRIORITY (for test w/ 10 friends):
	-- DEPLOY May 8, LAUNCH May 11 --
	
= C 2 - add Create your own poll or news post on the left bottom of each news cat (PART I complete - the link.  TODO: feed category from url to default value.)	

C 2 - Break word by width=50% if any option len > 20	

C 3 - max username length is 345 - this is too long!

C 5 - prompt to log in makes you forget your place.  It should open in new window / close window, or remember from location and restore it later.

C 5 - why you voted comment

C 8 - Need to scan page for og:image and use that as a backup.

C 8 - Change between alias and real name depending on a post's (or comment's) privacy settings.

C 8 + ability to message other users or write on a news source' wall

C 8 - organize cat posts in columns to save vertical space, on desktop... oh yeah, there's a reason I didn't do that, it's because of sorting order desktop vs mobile... hmmm.  Send both versions with a media query to decide which to show?  looking up poll option would have to search both of them?  Or just serve the column version, but put high-priority articles in left, low-priority on the right?

C 13 - notifications

  - Enable DDOS prevention somehow
  
  - Allow user to create simple, plaintext Blog (with image insertion for body or just thumbnail).

  -   Alert-for-needing-to-log-in pages should use the modal windows, like viewVoteResults does.  Can prompt for logging in as well.

  - Email system.  Needs to:
  
B 5  =   Fix email - Emailed DO tech support.

  -   Implement Email verification.

  -   Implement Forgot password.
  
  -   Remember previous page or close form upon success, and/or back tri buttons.
 
  -   Send verification email... user doesn't get created until email gets verified.
      Verify email and set emailVerified=True when email is verified

C   - c Univ' - prog intern' + phys' prof'

C 3 - newly-created posts for 'NEWS' show up under 'WORLD NEWS' - country should be set based on whether user is in the US?

C 8 - collapse in columnwise the articles, when viewing a single category or polls.

C 8 - thumbnail appears to be clipped on the left, on mobile - it appears smart crop doesn't always do what I want.  Experiment with manually centering the image, compare results, go with the better option and don't look back.

C 8 - make large_thumbnails (otherwise, a cat takes too long to load... or reduce kMaxArticles to 100?) - but could this get costly?

  - add ability to view news source feed 
  
  - add ability to view user feed

  - ++ created polls to history
  
C 2 - Ryan: "The ellipsis for long comments should be more obvious >> blue and test like show more and an arrow -> or something like that"

D ? - Ryan: "I am unable to post comments with unicode characters. It fails without reporting an error (you only see it if you look in the xhr). Posting a poll allows some unicode characters but most get translated into those strange diamonds with question marks."  
    
D ? - When calculating if some text is too long, counts the number of bytes, not displayed Unicode characters.
