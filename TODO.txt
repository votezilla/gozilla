   	test w/ -testBatch=true which will just send to test emails (test db column for which users have testable emails)
	cont @ email.go:93

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20696041/window-openurl-blank-not-working-on-imac-safari

C also zipping for  static/ any mime type text

C 3 - erase old large thumbnails.  (eventually, small thumbnails?)

C 5 - article poll voting - image too large; but viewPollResults has no image at all.  Fix?

C - great 10-step guide to optimization!!! - https://www.eurovps.com/blog/reasons-for-slow-website-loading/#:~:text=A%20large%20volume%20of%20unoptimized,your%20website%20to%20load%20slowly.

C 3 - list news sources and ppl

C 3 - In history, display comments overview with the article.  Hmm.. realizing this may need to become an Activity-style list, sorted by time

C 8 - load comments AFTER article - could use an iframe.  this will speed up in-site article load time.

C 8 - for user-uploaded article, the sidebar should have more polls / article uploaded from that user.

NEW STUFF:

//[] Scroll keeps bringing up new topics.  When you reach bottom, infinite scroll has MORE NEWS, MORE WORLD NEWS, etc.
//   Then EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE MORE NEWS, OODLES OF NEWS, etc.  Kind of humorous.


- tutorial should be very short

- 8 dino colors would be really cool. For user portrait, but that also becomes the color of the default image.  Use userId % 8. (If user later updates their profile pic, it will down sample to make their avatar.  Or they could just change their color too.)


C - ChicaWhisperer article sidebar says more from [blank]:

C - vote timeline - looks cool and doesn't require much data.  Need to add time to table.

D - write go script (via flag) to clear test votes.

C 21 - infinite scroll I'd you keep scrolling down

D 21 - the bottom of each cat c have carousel / next / prev buttons to dynamically load and pan to more articles in an ArticleGroup

- add notif if some1 liked ur comment?

C - Google Analytics

C 13 - TOM: Tickertape news would be cool

C - RYAN - I'd like to have links or additional inline documentation before taking a poll. oh, you could have an optional voter's pamphlet for each poll. Weird thing--as I am typing this the page kept scrolling back to the top. (RYAN)


D - Create db flag to mark test accounts I've created.

D - front page should perhaps only show you news + polls you haven't clicked on yet?


D 13 - TOM - 1st impression = what is this?  (Need splashscreen(s) / tutorial(s) / about page) (TOM)
   - (include what up / down / comment icons do, since Tom didn't naturally figure them out.)

D 21 - More topics!!!  Use keyword-AI to do this.  Also for searching.

D - fix double 'Welcome to Votezilla' message with cookies.  Note: cookies are currently broken, multiple at once at least, so this could be unnecessarily tricky.
    Ref: https://smartlazycoding.com/javascript-tutorial/change-the-url-without-reloading-the-page

D - when you save secure cookie, save it too both Votezilla.io and Votezilla.newz?

D - push favicon.ico if not logged in

TOM FEEDBACK:
D - TOM: Add Votezilla to search engines.  (He tried to search for votezilla.io on the search engine!) (Need to optimize and improve SEO first!) (TOM)

~ - no login problems - it was easy! (TOM)

~ - "I don't like questions that require an expert answer." (about quantum physics, self-driving polls) (TOM)

~ - on poll, wondered if he could press ENTER instead of clicking on the Vote button.   (TOM)

GORDON FEEDBACK:
Regarding your feedback:
* I need to rework the whole “Welcome to Votezilla” part of the sign-in process.  Probably, it (and the rest of registration) should work like this:
  - If the user is not logged in when they try to vote or do something, there should be an in-page pop-up prompting them to log in or register.
  - During registration, I should maybe put off asking them for the demographic stuff, to not lose people.  Of course, I also don't want to lose that data.
  - After logging in or signing up, it should take them to the page or action they were going to do before they signed up / logged in.  There should also be an in-page pop-up prompt, with some tutorial links for how to do stuff.
* Re: voting and hitting the back button, discrepancies in # votes (2 of your issues):
 - The main page is currently being cached, as an optimization.  Saves about a half second of load time.  This probably results in the number of votes being off.
   -- I'm going to remove this optimization, for a couple reasons:
     1. It might be causing an issue on the server where the whole site goes down and I have to restart the server.
     2. It causes temporary discrepancies in number of votes, like the one you shared with me.  (Thanks for sharing it, cause it's the type of thing I wasn't sure if people would notice.)
     3. I'm planning on splitting Polls vs News into their own tabs anyways, since people seem to interact more with polls.
* Re: the polls feeling cluttered:
 - I've heard similar feedback from others.  Can you describe what feels cluttered?  Do you have any ideas how to fix the clutter?
 - So I think some of the issue here is I was basing the poll layout on the layout I've been using for news, since I implemented the news first.
 - However, what I should consider doing is removing completely or shrinking the poll image, then using the extra space to give the poll options more width.
 - I've also seen some polling websites put a rectangle around each poll option, which you can click on.
 - Does anything else about polls feel cluttered, or are there any tweaks you think I should consider?
* Re: paywalls
 - Yes, I need to remove the paywall news sources.
* Re: your comments not displaying on activity feed:
 - It doesn't show your own activity, but the activity of others.  To see your own activity, click on the dino icon on the upper-right that has your username.

There are a number of reasons why online voting makes sense, the coronavirus is just highlighting it more than ever with the threat of delaying our elections.  However, there is a lot of UNDERSTANDABLE and VALID mistrust of electronic voting.  The best way to remove the mistrust is for the voting technology to be independently verified and scanned for potential exploits.  I wonder if something like blockchain could be used."
