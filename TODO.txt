db opt!  723ms - 258ms = 465ms saved!!!  (Chrome dev tools, network tab, caching enabled.)


WORKING ON:


profiling

         )

B 1 - Poll options need a "Poll options:" label for the group, possibly the character o or [] in front.

B 1 - Delete ugly, old polls.

B 3 - RYAN: The alert after logging in should be removed.

B 3 - Ryan's poll with the weird characters... if I vote for the 2nd option as "2 1" with ranked choices, it tells me below that I voted for the wrong one.

B 8 - privacy alias'

      Also, dump in other notes with written stuff, from my notebook.

- when signing up, store referrer in server side cookie, to return signed in person to that page.  Instead of javascript alert, popup with Welcome to Votezilla.  Store in cookie so this does not reactivate, somehow.

- C - OPT: webp - https://godoc.org/github.com/harukasan/go-libwebp/webp#EncodeRGBA

- C - when they're going to post to news but registerdetails country isn't set yet, warn (via popup) and offer link to registerDetails to complete registration to fix this.

- jeff, dad - forgotaccount not set up yet

- cat highlight when u move mouse over

- bug - visited links f Activity are remaining blue

- OPT: materialize recent news every 5 minutes(if there is a new post), also for more news, more more news.  5 variations for reload variation, so do one request / minute with a modular cycle i.e. a circular Q.  Could prerender the news HTML even, if user upvote and poll vote data is sent to the JS to be added!!!

- at bottom of news add more cats links as rounded flat rectangular buttons, with infinite scroll that displays more /news (each news cat plus other categories), fetches against materialized tables joined with user upvotes

C 3 - list news sources and ppl

C 3 - In history, display comments overview with the article.  Hmm.. realizing this may need to become an Activity-style list, sorted by time

C 21 - More topics!!!  Use keyword-AI to do this.  Also for searching.

C 13 - 1st impression = what is this?  (Need splashscreen(s) / tutorial(s) / about page) (TOM)
   - (include what up / down / comment icons do, since Tom didn't naturally figure them out.)

C 8 - fill in Polls category - to remove white space

C 8 - load comments AFTER article - could use an iframe.  this will speed up in-site article load time.

C 8 - for user-uploaded article, the sidebar should have more polls / article uploaded from that user.

NEW STUFF:

//[] Scroll keeps bringing up new topics.  When you reach bottom, infinite scroll has MORE NEWS, MORE WORLD NEWS, etc.
//   Then EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE MORE NEWS, OODLES OF NEWS, etc.  Kind of humorous.


- tutorial should be very short

- 8 dino colors would be really cool. For user portrait, but that also becomes the color of the default image.  Use userId % 8. (If user later updates their profile pic, it will down sample to make their avatar.  Or they could just change their color too.)



- refresh icon on top to load more news

- I need to create interesting polls

B - default user-created posts to US (?)

C - ChicaWhisperer article sidebar says more from [blank]:

C - vote timeline - looks cool and doesn't require much data.  Need to add time to table.

D - write go script (via flag) to clear test votes.

C 21 - infinite scroll I'd you keep scrolling down

D 21 - the bottom of each cat c have carousel / next / prev buttons to dynamically load and pan to more articles in an ArticleGroup

- add notif if some1 liked ur comment?

C - Google Analytics

C 13 - TOM: Tickertape news would be cool

D - Create db flag to mark test accounts I've created.

D - front page should perhaps only show you news + polls you haven't clicked on yet?

FEEDBACK:
C - discussion on what to do when there are too many poll items: http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults2/?postId=95391#comment_71 (may need to change url to viewPollResults w/o 2
  ^ Ryan H: Only listing the first three options in the summary is going to influence votes. Try not including the poll choices in the summary at all? or at least not be able to vote from the summary? Should polls have descriptions? (yes).

C - I'd like to have links or additional inline documentation before taking a poll. oh, you could have an optional voter's pamphlet for each poll. Weird thing--as I am typing this the page kept scrolling back to the top. (RYAN)

TOM FEEDBACK:
D - TOM: Add Votezilla to search engines.  (He tried to search for votezilla.io on the search engine!) (Need to optimize and improve SEO first!) (TOM)

~ - no login problems - it was easy! (TOM)

~ - "I don't like questions that require an expert answer." (about quantum physics, self-driving polls) (TOM)

MED-HIGH PRIORITY (for test w/ 10 friends):
	-- DEPLOY May 8, LAUNCH May 11 --

= C 2 - add Create your own poll or news post on the left bottom of each news cat (PART I complete - the link.  TODO: feed category from url to default value.)

C 2 - Break word by width=50% if any option len > 20

C 3 - max username length is 345 - this is too long!

C 3 - voting from history doesn't work when there are duplicates.  Could just manually remove duplicates in Go after the query.

C 5 - prompt to log in makes you forget your place.  It should open in new window / close window, or remember from location and restore it later.

C 5 - why you voted comment

C 8 - Change between alias and real name depending on a post's (or comment's) privacy settings.

C 8 + ability to message other users or write on a news source' wall

C 8 - organize cat posts in columns to save vertical space, on desktop... oh yeah, there's a reason I didn't do that, it's because of sorting order desktop vs mobile... hmmm.  Send both versions with a media query to decide which to show?  looking up poll option would have to search both of them?  Or just serve the column version, but put high-priority articles in left, low-priority on the right?

C 13 - notifications


  - Allow user to create simple, plaintext Blog (with image insertion for body or just thumbnail).

  -   Alert-for-needing-to-log-in pages should use the modal windows, like viewVoteResults does.  Can prompt for logging in as well.

  - Email system.  Needs to:

C   - c Univ' - prog intern' + phys' prof'

C 3 - newly-created posts for 'NEWS' show up under 'WORLD NEWS' - country should be set based on whether user is in the US?

C 8 - collapse in columnwise the articles, when viewing a single category or polls.

C 8 - thumbnail appears to be clipped on the left, on mobile - it appears smart crop doesn't always do what I want.  Experiment with manually centering the image, compare results, go with the better option and don't look back.

D ? - When calculating if some text is too long, counts the number of bytes, not displayed Unicode characters.

B ? - Ryan: "Lookin better duder!  I still think the polls / articles need better separation.  Maybe a border?  For me this is a big deal."

- Ryan: "When ready, Votezilla should be open sourced.  A core tenet of Votezilla could be the integrity of its voting system -- and as a potential leap, one day for a national online voting site.  There are a number of reasons why online voting makes sense, the coronavirus is just highlighting it more than ever with the threat of delaying our elections.  However, there is a lot of UNDERSTANDABLE and VALID mistrust of electronic voting.  The best way to remove the mistrust is for the voting technology to be independently verified and scanned for potential exploits.  I wonder if something like blockchain could be used."
