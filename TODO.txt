POLLS:

Importance
v
  Difficulty
  v

A - 8 - make large_thumbnails (otherwise, a cat takes too long to load... or reduce kMaxArticles to 100?) - but could this get costly?

A - . - Continue getting feedback from close peeps!!  (Start with Susan, Steve D., Jeff, Tom, Dad, )

A - 3 - sharing articles nees better thumbnail - use og:image, og:Title

A - 8 - Add num notifications javascript on 1 minute timer that asks how many notifications the person should have.. will need
	will need service, JS timer and ajax call, plus table to keep track of notifications that have been clicked on.

A 8 - upgrade DigitalOcean instance $5 -> $10

B - 5 - Add more activities notifications (for now, a notification for every vote (by Created time, nd to add)), reply to your comment, notification for upvoted articles.

B - security - password timeout

B 2 - Poll options need a "Poll options:" label for the group, possibly the character o or [] in front.

B 3 - Ryan's poll with the weird characters... if I vote for the 2nd option as "2 1" with ranked choices, it tells me below that I voted for the wrong one.

B 5 - Add more news API's (hopefully some incl. Fox News)

B 8 - privacy alias'

B 8 - ability to delete posts, comments

B 8 - ability to update posts, comments

B 8 - Allow user to specify new category when creating poll or post, then group all unmatched under Other category.

B 8 - Add "About" section - or implement simple blog first?

B 13 - display the results of polls you've voted on, on /news.  May require a pollTallyService to count results ahead of time and store them in a json column in the poll.

B 8 - newlines are getting stripped from comments, and markdown would be nice.

B   - disallow multiple poll items with the same name

B - "You must be logged in to do that!" - should be popup with kind, pretty prompt

B - load comments AFTER article - could use an iframe.  this will speed up in-site article load time.

B - great 10-step guide to optimization!!! - https://www.eurovps.com/blog/reasons-for-slow-website-loading/#:~:text=A%20large%20volume%20of%20unoptimized,your%20website%20to%20load%20slowly.

C 3 - list news sources and ppl

C 3 - In history, display comments overview with the article.  Hmm.. realizing this may need to become an Activity-style list, sorted by time

C 13 - 1st impression = what is this?  (Need splashscreen(s) / tutorial(s) / about page) (TOM)
   - (include what up / down / comment icons do, since Tom didn't naturally figure them out.)


NEW STUFF:

//[] Scroll keeps bringing up new topics.  When you reach bottom, infinite scroll has MORE NEWS, MORE WORLD NEWS, etc.
//   Then EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE NEWS, YET EVEN MORE MORE NEWS, OODLES OF NEWS, etc.  Kind of humorous.


- tutorial should be very short

- 8 dino colors would be really cool. For user portrait, but that also becomes the color of the default image.  Use userId % 8. (If user later updates their profile pic, it will down sample to make their avatar.  Or they could just change their color too.)



- A- - It would be nice if urls in comments became links. also basic html tags.

- refresh icon on top to load more news

- I need to create interesting polls

- B - default user-created posts to US (?)

- C - ChicaWhisperer article sidebar says more from [blank]:

- page never loads, probably crashes: http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults/?postId=3589#commentsTarget
  BUT then it started working.  Maybe server was chugging?

- B - n 2 add demographic breakdown to polls because it's cool.

- C - vote timeline - looks cool and doesn't require much data.  Need to add time to table.

 - cacheService for unloggedIn users?  w h SEO?

 - D - write go script (via flag) to clear test votes.

 - C 21 - infinite scroll I'd you keep scrolling down

- D 21 - the bottom of each cat c have carousel / next / prev buttons to dynamically load and pan to more articles in an ArticleGroup

- B 3 - add og:image to Votezilla pages

- add notif if some1 liked ur comment?

- Google Analytics

FEEDBACK:
C - discussion on what to do when there are too many poll items: http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults2/?postId=95391#comment_71 (may need to change url to viewPollResults w/o 2
  ^ Ryan H: Only listing the first three options in the summary is going to influence votes. Try not including the poll choices in the summary at all? or at least not be able to vote from the summary? Should polls have descriptions? (yes).

C - I'd like to have links or additional inline documentation before taking a poll. oh, you could have an optional voter's pamphlet for each poll. Weird thing--as I am typing this the page kept scrolling back to the top. (RYAN)

TOM FEEDBACK:
D - TOM: Add Votezilla to search engines.  (He tried to search for votezilla.io on the search engine!) (Need to optimize and improve SEO first!) (TOM)

~ - no login problems - it was easy! (TOM)

~ - "I don't like questions that require an expert answer." (about quantum physics, self-driving polls) (TOM)

~ - on poll, wondered if he could press ENTER instead of clicking on the Vote button.   (TOM)




MED-HIGH PRIORITY (for test w/ 10 friends):
	-- DEPLOY May 8, LAUNCH May 11 --

= C 2 - add Create your own poll or news post on the left bottom of each news cat (PART I complete - the link.  TODO: feed category from url to default value.)

C 2 - Break word by width=50% if any option len > 20

C 3 - max username length is 345 - this is too long!

C 3 - voting from history doesn't work when there are duplicates.  Could just manually remove duplicates in Go after the query.

C 5 - prompt to log in makes you forget your place.  It should open in new window / close window, or remember from location and restore it later.

C 5 - why you voted comment

C 8 - Need to scan page for og:image and use that as a backup.

C 8 - Change between alias and real name depending on a post's (or comment's) privacy settings.

C 8 + ability to message other users or write on a news source' wall

C 8 - organize cat posts in columns to save vertical space, on desktop... oh yeah, there's a reason I didn't do that, it's because of sorting order desktop vs mobile... hmmm.  Send both versions with a media query to decide which to show?  looking up poll option would have to search both of them?  Or just serve the column version, but put high-priority articles in left, low-priority on the right?

C 13 - notifications


  - Allow user to create simple, plaintext Blog (with image insertion for body or just thumbnail).

  -   Alert-for-needing-to-log-in pages should use the modal windows, like viewVoteResults does.  Can prompt for logging in as well.

  - Email system.  Needs to:

B 5  =   Fix email - Emailed DO tech support.

  -   Implement Email verification.

  -   Implement Forgot password.

  -   Remember previous page or close form upon success, and/or back tri buttons.

  -   Send verification email... user doesn't get created until email gets verified.
      Verify email and set emailVerified=True when email is verified

C   - c Univ' - prog intern' + phys' prof'

C 3 - newly-created posts for 'NEWS' show up under 'WORLD NEWS' - country should be set based on whether user is in the US?

C 8 - collapse in columnwise the articles, when viewing a single category or polls.

C 8 - thumbnail appears to be clipped on the left, on mobile - it appears smart crop doesn't always do what I want.  Experiment with manually centering the image, compare results, go with the better option and don't look back.

  - add ability to view news source feed

  - add ability to view user feed

  - ++ created polls to history

C 2 - Ryan: "The ellipsis for long comments should be more obvious >> blue and test like show more and an arrow -> or something like that"

C 2 - history tab should be hidden when user is not logged in

D 2 - ranked vote checkbox should list the rank.

D 3 - sort history just by time posted desc

D 2 - RYAN: I don't want to have to dig into the comments to find the info -- it should be in the poll description.

D - categories - lighten color when hovering?

D ? - When calculating if some text is too long, counts the number of bytes, not displayed Unicode characters.

B ? - Ryan: "Lookin better duder!  I still think the polls / articles need better separation.  Maybe a border?  For me this is a big deal."

- Ryan: "When ready, Votezilla should be open sourced.  A core tenet of Votezilla could be the integrity of its voting system -- and as a potential leap, one day for a national online voting site.  There are a number of reasons why online voting makes sense, the coronavirus is just highlighting it more than ever with the threat of delaying our elections.  However, there is a lot of UNDERSTANDABLE and VALID mistrust of electronic voting.  The best way to remove the mistrust is for the voting technology to be independently verified and scanned for potential exploits.  I wonder if something like blockchain could be used."

   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
