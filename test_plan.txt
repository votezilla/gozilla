BUGS LOCALLY COMMITTED:

BUG FIXES BEING PUSHED TO SERVER:

BUGS FIXED:
- On Edge, long text title or poll items other polls, in /news.  This occurs when there are really long words.
  This occurs on my Edge (44.19041.1.0), not on Tom's (81.0.416.88).  Fixed, possibly, but it was for old IE browsers 
  which is a low market share.
- createPoll was crashing due to SQL error, fixed.
- Fixed article close button
- Fixed a bug preventing the ability to see immediate progress from up / down vote of any article in /news.  (Because I'd removed the anchor on a previous check-in.)

BUGS I WON'T FIX THIS PUSH:
