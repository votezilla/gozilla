Truth. I'm taking up the good fight by creating an online platform for people to create and vote on polls, share news, and have positive political discussion. It supports ranked voting, anonymity (so your opinion won't get you fired), and is censorship-free. It's called Votezilla. I could use your support. Let's use the Freedom Machine to defeat the Oppression Machine: http://votezilla.news/


I've got another project in the works too, a social network called Votezilla, for people to create and vote on polls, share and read news, and discuss politics in a positive, anonymous, and also censorship-free environment. Feel free to check it out! http://votezilla.news

To anyone fed up with censorship, I've created a censorship-free social network called Votezilla, for speaking openly, creating and voting in polls, and sharing news!  You're invited to join, and I could use your support.  It's in beta right now, and I could use your feedback.  http://votezilla.io

So I'm working on another project,  Votezilla.  A censorship-free social network based on creating polls, voting, sharing news, and positive political discussion.



Regarding E-Direct Democracy,


Hey guys, I've been building a social network called Votezilla that's all about creating and voting on polls, reading and sharing news, and having positive political discussion, without all the censorship. Feel free to check it out: http://votezilla.news
I see this as a way to introduce a little bit of E-Democracy into our representative system, by being a way to hold our leaders accountable to the will of the public.
It's pretty new, I'm still implementing features, and I haven't started pushing it yet, but I'd love if you could check it out and leave me any feedback, that would be awesome.
