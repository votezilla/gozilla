Politics is broken in many ways. Democracy is in danger of being eradicated by big tech companies and the mainstream media who purposely silence those who do not agree with their political views. Polls are rigged, and mainstream media lies and cover ups the truth. Votezilla is an app and a movement to fix that. At www.votezilla.news, anyone can join for free, vote on existing polls, add options to existing polls, create their own poll, and comment on news articles. The app has been launched and is now ready for everyone to vote, interact, connect with others and have a little fun.

This social media app has the potential of becoming one of the world’s best sources for gathering accurate polling data and information without skewing the results in any way, shape or form. Not only that, but also VoteZilla includes ranked voting, and the polling data can be summarized by demographic, race, sex or age in order to get an accurate pulse on the thoughts and feelings of the participants; thereby restoring the voice and the will of the people.

It also supports joining the results of two separate polls together, to see how many people that support issue A feel about issue B.  This unlocks another level of human understanding and political insight.

Politics is supposed to be the process of a select few number of elected officials making decisions for the benefit of the whole. However, politics today is rife with abuses of power, echo chambers that fall on deaf ears, and a two-party system that has a dangerous polarizing effect. Our politicians, mainstream media, and big tech companies who own all of social media are actively censoring the public at large, and it’s only getting worse. In addition, they have pushed the cancel culture that threatens those who speak their mind.

Democracy isn’t just being attacked. It’s been knocked down and the count has just started…

However, not all hope is lost. Positive political discussion can be used to discuss the pros / cons of difficult issues, and unify different sides to common goals that we can agree upon. For what we cannot agree on, online polling can reveal how the population and various demographics feel on different issues, and this can be used to inform and persuade our politicians to do the right thing. With Ranked Voting, we can elect the best candidates, not simply those who have risen to power in the Two Party System. And we can use anonymity to allow people to vote and speak their mind without fear of losing their job.
Get a million people together, and the Berlin Wall crumbles.

Let’s be the change we all want to see…
