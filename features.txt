        X "Party" -> Add other common parties, like Libertarian, Socialist, Progressive?

X fixed weird voting issue

X fixed duplicate news posts in DB bug

X A 2 - article - add back nav arrow

X A 3 - See phone screenshot of weird science articles - 2367w old nat geo article, then only new-scientist.  (so nat geo is bad timestamp and then sorted very far back in the Q.)

X removed polls from processing in imageService, because not needed.

X added unique constraint for vz.newspost on (title, newsourceid)

Y 2 - ++ "..." for items that are too long, when viewing results (Don't need now, since I cap the length to 50)

B 1 - add spacing around bottommost "more..." on /news

C 5 - Too many tabs open

B 2 - only show news posts w/ thumbnails  (still show other types of posts)

Found & fixed while testing:
- On Edge, long text title or poll items other polls, in /news.  This occurs when there are really long words.
  This occurs on my Edge (44.19041.1.0), not on Tom's (81.0.416.88).  Fixed, possibly, but it was for old IE browsers
  which is a low market share.

- createPoll was crashing due to SQL error, fixed.

- Fixed article close button

- Fixed a bug preventing the ability to see immediate progress from up / down vote of any article in /news.  (Because I'd removed the anchor on a previous check-in.)

A 2 - why does this poll sort so highly?: "Create a test poll question with lots of words and options and also it"

JUST FIXED (7/22):
A 13 - Want to view poll results on /news & /article once you've voted on it
     - Shorten poll results via ... so it takes less space.  Maybe rename to VOTED:

A 5 - equalize /news article order a little / prioritize page rank multiplied by less.

A 13 - Need ability to add new option when voting

A 2 - try defaulting polls to no flags set.  (http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults/?postId=88165)  Ryan H.: "I chose None because I noticed several polls where it did not make sense to choose more than one option and accidentally did so myself. It would be nice to be able to change a poll if there have not been any votes on it (except maybe your own). Need to be able to delete a poll or post or comment."

A - 2 - Article (poll) - need smaller header image because it's hiding poll from user, creating confusion.
    ^^ I addressed this by anchoring user to the start of the poll when they go there.
A - 2 - clicking on comment icon from /news - should take you to "leave a comment" anchor - otherwise, confusing (TOM)

A - 2 - on multi-select poll, divide by total not max, so it adds up to 100% (TOM)

C - 2 - have back button for polls go back to POLLS

B 2 - make polls that have results abbreviated (due to long option text) should list # of votes.

Added POLLS to history; Improved poll layout a little: Made them kNoHeadlines; shrunk poll dino images a little; increase num visible poll items from 3/8 to 12/12.

	also implemented votezilla.news and www.votezilla.news

FIXES:
B 1 - fixed up/down icon positioning

B 3 - fixed nonheadline articles being too many lines;

A 3 - fixed a voting bug that revealed another voter's vote in /history

B 8 - Fixed issues with poll options - both when creating poll, and when a new option is being added.

A - 1 - /create isn't telling ppl to log in first

8/19
A 13 - cool header icon idea for mobile:
	x square large icon with text underneath.
	x vz, which links to about Votezilla stuff, and c h subtext "about".
	x profile (username) on right, logout is within here so not cluttering main menu.
	x Then play with the order of these, leftmost = news, "updates" (instead of activity) 2nd from right so easy to click on.
	x Will need to handle logged out case: log in / sign up, somehow.
	x "create" could say "create / share".
	x jeff likes the FB pencil for create

8/20
A - 8 - make large_thumbnails

A - add expires headers - Implemented... at least according to Chrome and Firefox, it's cached.  pingdom.com only looks for the Expires tag so doesn't recognize it.  But it seems to work in Chrome.

8/31
A - 5 - GORDON & SUSAN: switch Sign Up and Create New Account, move Sign Up, to make simpler for new users.

B 2 - Condense demographic ages: <=17, 18-41, 42-63, 64+

A - 13 - Implemented demographic breakdown (available when 5+ or 10+ votes)

9/25:
A - uncache news + polls, see if it fixes the server issue
A - 8 - Tried separating news from polls, news into its own tab, move /about into part of /history.
      - Didn't look good.  But now at least there's a flag that I can turn it on with.
B+ 8 - organize cat posts in columns to save vertical space, on desktop... oh yeah, there's a reason I didn't do that, it's because of sorting order desktop vs mobile... hmmm.  Send both versions with a media query to decide which to show?  looking up poll option would have to search both of them?  Or just serve the column version, but put high-priority articles in left, low-priority on the right?
- deprioritize posts you've interacted w
A - 5 - Added more spacing between articles.
