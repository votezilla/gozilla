X fixed weird voting issue

X A 2 - article - add back nav arrow

X A 3 - See phone screenshot of weird science articles - 2367w old nat geo article, then only new-scientist.  (so nat geo is bad timestamp and then sorted very far back in the Q.)

X removed polls from processing in imageService, because not needed.

X added unique constraint for vz.newspost on (title, newsourceid)

A 2 - incr voting + comment power for now

A fixed issue where default thumbnail wasn't showing up during link post creation

B 1 - add spacing around bottommost "more..." on /news

C 5 - Too many tabs open

B 2 - only show news posts w/ thumbnails  (still show other types of posts)

Found & fixed while testing:
- On Edge, long text title or poll items other polls, in /news.  This occurs when there are really long words.
  This occurs on my Edge (44.19041.1.0), not on Tom's (81.0.416.88).  Fixed, possibly, but it was for old IE browsers
  which is a low market share.

- createPoll was crashing due to SQL error, fixed.

- Fixed article close button

- Fixed a bug preventing the ability to see immediate progress from up / down vote of any article in /news.  (Because I'd removed the anchor on a previous check-in.)

A 2 - why does this poll sort so highly?: "Create a test poll question with lots of words and options and also it"

JUST FIXED (7/22):
A 13 - Want to view poll results on /news & /article once you've voted on it
     - Shorten poll results via ... so it takes less space.  Maybe rename to VOTED:

A 5 - equalize /news article order a little / prioritize page rank multiplied by less.

A 13 - Need ability to add new option when voting

A 2 - try defaulting polls to no flags set.  (http://votezilla.io/viewPollResults/?postId=88165)  Ryan H.: "I chose None because I noticed several polls where it did not make sense to choose more than one option and accidentally did so myself. It would be nice to be able to change a poll if there have not been any votes on it (except maybe your own). Need to be able to delete a poll or post or comment."

A - 2 - Article (poll) - need smaller header image because it's hiding poll from user, creating confusion.
    ^^ I addressed this by anchoring user to the start of the poll when they go there.
A - 2 - clicking on comment icon from /news - should take you to "leave a comment" anchor - otherwise, confusing (TOM)

A - 2 - on multi-select poll, divide by total not max, so it adds up to 100% (TOM)

C - 2 - have back button for polls go back to POLLS

B 2 - make polls that have results abbreviated (due to long option text) should list # of votes.

Added POLLS to history; Improved poll layout a little: Made them kNoHeadlines; shrunk poll dino images a little; increase num visible poll items from 3/8 to 12/12.
