MISC FIXED THINGS:

	X remove autocap f username
	
	X dropdown text cutoff
	
	X "Select" text for dropdowns

        X (optional) animate placeholder text to label / try always having label (Tried, it didn't look good.  Code is commented out in template file.)

        X "Party" -> "Choose a Party"

        X "Other" -> add text input
        
        X "Other" -> didn't let him register
        
        X "Party" -> Add other common parties, like Libertarian, Socialist, Progressive?

X Make up / ranking / down + n comments bigger on mobile, so ppl c C / click on it!  Aldo top menu.  May need to keep vz but remove votezilla for space on top?
