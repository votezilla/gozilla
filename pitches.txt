Personal email pitch:

Hey <<First name>>,

<<Personal message>>

Just wanted to let you know, I've been working on a new website called Votezilla.  It's a polling & news platform that improves the world by supporting ranked voting, positive political discussion, direct democracy, and freedom from censorship.  It's an open forum where anyone can create their own polls.  There is anonymity, because sharing your opinion should never cause you to lose your friends or your job.

I would really love it if you could check it out.  The website is http://votezilla.news

We have a new presidential poll.  If you could take a minute and cast your vote, that would mean a lot to me.  (Plus, one lucky voter will win $100!)

Thank you so much,
Aaron Smith

^^ This is a censorship-free platform I'm creating for voting, positive political discussion, and sharing of news. Facebook and Twitter censor the Right and manipulate people into arguments that cost relationships and jobs. Votezilla does not does believe in any of that. One we get enough voters, I'd love to invite Trump himself onto our platform!

Votezilla is a platform I just created.  If we could 1 million of our friends doing these polls, or better yet 100 million, we'd start to see laws being passed that actually represent the will of the people.

Thanks for the vote, ___. Would you mind voting in my poll? I'm building a website called Votezilla, with the goal to make politics better with awesome polls and positive political discussion. Here it is: https://votezilla.news/article/?postId=376999#vote


If we can get 1 million or 100 million people practicing ranked vote polling online, it will naturally translate into real life. Take protests, for instance - they're basically a show of numbers. Get a million people together, and the Berlin Wall crumbles. We can do the same thing with online polls, as long as they have a real political purpose behind them. If 100 million people do an online poll for an election where candidate A or B is expected to win, but candidate C blows them out of water online, people will now know they can vote for candidate C without "wasting" their vote.

VOTEZILLA GROUP WELCOME MESSAGE:
Welcome to Votezilla, everyone!  Politics is broken in many ways, and Votezilla represents a movement to fix that.

Politics is the process of a society collectively attempting to make decisions that benefit the whole.  However, politics today is rife with abuses of power, echo chambers and two-party systems that have a dangerous polarizing effect, censorship, false narratives by the media, and a cancel culture that threatens those who speak their mind.

However, all hope is not lost.  The Internet is an incredible tool, and used the right way, we can bring about the types of positive change we want to see.  Positive politics discussion can be used to discuss the pros / cons of different issues, and unify different sides to common goals that we can agree on.  For what we cannot agree on, online polling can reveal how the population and various demographics feel on different issues, and this can be used to inform and persuade our politicians to do the right thing.  With Ranked Voting, we can elect the best candidates, not simply those who have risen to power in the Two Party System.  We can use anonymity to allow people to vote and speak their mind without losing their job.

Get a million people together, and the Berlin Wall crumbles.

Thank you all for joining this group.  Together, we can change the world!

Truth. I'm taking up the good fight by creating an online platform for people to create and vote on polls, share news, and have positive political discussion. It supports ranked voting, anonymity (so your opinion won't get you fired), and is censorship-free. It's called Votezilla. I could use your support. Let's use the Freedom Machine to defeat the Oppression Machine: http://votezilla.news/


I've got another project in the works too, a social network called Votezilla, for people to create and vote on polls, share and read news, and discuss politics in a positive, anonymous, and also censorship-free environment. Feel free to check it out! http://votezilla.news

To anyone fed up with censorship, I've created a censorship-free social network called Votezilla, for speaking openly, creating and voting in polls, and sharing news!  You're invited to join, and I could use your support.  It's in beta right now, and I could use your feedback.  http://votezilla.io

So I'm working on another project,  Votezilla.  A censorship-free social network based on creating polls, voting, sharing news, and positive political discussion.



Regarding E-Direct Democracy,


Hey guys, I've been building a social network called Votezilla that's all about creating and voting on polls, reading and sharing news, and having positive political discussion, without all the censorship. Feel free to check it out: http://votezilla.news
I see this as a way to introduce a little bit of E-Democracy into our representative system, by being a way to hold our leaders accountable to the will of the public.
It's pretty new, I'm still implementing features, and I haven't started pushing it yet, but I'd love if you could check it out and leave me any feedback, that would be awesome.


Like Isaac Arthur, I too am interested in ensuring the integrity of our democratic process.
